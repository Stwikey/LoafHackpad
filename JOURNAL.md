# June 4th: Finished making the schematic and pcb

I finished making the schematic and pcb layout for my hackpad during the roadtrip meeting! I followed the hackpad tutorial for the most part which made things simple and helped me to make little mistakes but I decided to do 6 keys instead of 4

# June 13th: Finished making case and firmware

I followed along the hackpad tutorial to make the case but decided to add my own design. Its supposed to be a cat loaf and I plan to paint it so it looks nicer and more like a bread. Using fusion was kind of hard because I never used it before so it took longer than expected lol.

I also followed along the tutorial for the firmware and just needed to add some more keymaps for the extra keys that I added. I want to test out the current code first but hope to make something more advanced.

**Total time spent: 3h**
